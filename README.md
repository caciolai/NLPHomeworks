# NLPHomeworks

These are the two homeworks for the course of Natural Language Processing (A.Y. 2019/2020).

## Homework 1 - NER

The first homework's task has been to implement and train a model to perform *Named Entity Recognition* (NER).

Check the homework [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fdqhtja5p6xFijMHr_I543cYZvD4qz2qi4Qsin8U5gY/) and [repository](https://github.com/SapienzaNLP/nlp2020-hw1) for a more detailed description of the task.

### Implementation

[Here](NLP-2020-HW1.ipynb) is a copy of the Colab notebook in which I implemented my model and carried out its training.

### Report

[Here](report/NLP-2020-HW1.pdf) is the report with the documentation of my model and the results it attains.

## Homework 2 - SRL

The first homework's task has been to implement and train a model to perform *Semantic Role Labeling* (SRL).

Check the homework [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1olD7MtQULx95IuDL8JGFyvwXnqZ_mOY-tpzh0gvE4PE/) and [repository](https://github.com/SapienzaNLP/nlp2020-hw2) for a more detailed description of the task.

### Implementation
